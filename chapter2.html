        <h1>Chapter 2: The Scholar’s Notes</h1>
        
        <section class="story">
        <p>Lincoln sat in his dimly lit dorm room, the glow of his laptop screen casting long shadows on the walls. His discovery from the ancient manuscript had led him here—to an obscure reference in the notes of a long-forgotten biblical scholar, **Dr. Elias Holden**. </p>

        <p>Holden had spent years studying anomalies in ancient texts, believing that certain passages contained **hidden messages** encrypted using classical ciphers. His theories had been dismissed as conspiracy, and after his sudden disappearance, his research faded into obscurity.</p>

        <p>Lincoln’s search had brought him to a <a href="forum.html">cryptography forum</a>, where a user claiming to have access to Holden’s old research had posted a fragment of one of his letters. If Holden had encrypted a message, it was up to Lincoln to crack the code.</p>

        <h2>Holden’s Encrypted Letter</h2>
        <p>Lincoln leaned in closer, his pulse quickening. The message was scrambled—no key, no explanation, just a **jumbled sequence of letters**.</p>

        <div class="cryptogram">
    <p id="puzzle-text">GFA RJNHG YAQ TVH DAXAN IMHG</p>
</div>

        <p>It reminded Lincoln of **classic cryptograms**—messages where each letter was substituted with another, forming an encrypted passage. The only way to solve it was through **letter-frequency analysis** and pattern recognition.</p>

        <p><strong>Could Holden’s letter contain the first real clue?</strong></p>
