        <h1>Chapter 2: The Scholar's Notes</h1>
        
        <p>
            Lincoln Whitrush leaned back in his chair, staring at the dim glow of his laptop screen. The dusty manuscript he had scanned earlier still sat beside him, its brittle pages untouched for decades—perhaps centuries. 
            The simple Caesar cipher he cracked yesterday had revealed an unusual name: <strong>Matthias Holden</strong>, a 19th-century biblical scholar obsessed with hidden messages in scripture.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Holden’s work had been largely dismissed by his peers, and his final writings had vanished under unknown circumstances. That was, until now.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Lincoln had found them—Holden’s personal notes, buried deep within the university’s digital archives. 
            The files were a mess of old letters, fragmented thoughts, and seemingly random strings of text. But Lincoln knew better. 
            Holden hadn’t gone mad. He had been encoding something.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Flipping through the document, Lincoln spotted one passage that repeated variations of the same odd phrase over and over, sometimes with minor alterations. 
            This wasn’t random—this was <strong>structured</strong>. A pattern.
        </p>

        <p>Lincoln copied the passage into his notes and prepared to crack the code.</p>
