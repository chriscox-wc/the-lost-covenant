            <h2>Scene 1: The Discovery</h2>
            <p>Lincoln sat at his desk, surrounded by Elias Holden’s scattered notes. Most pages were filled with linguistic studies of ancient texts, but one stood out—handwritten numbers, repeated multiple times.</p>

            <p>His eyes traced the sequence: <b>4:7:5, 19:3:2, 12:9:4, 7:14:6</b>. Each set of numbers was written with near-obsessive precision.</p>

            <p>“Holden wasn’t just collecting numbers… he was pointing at something,” Lincoln muttered.</p>

            <p>At the top of the page, in faded ink, a phrase was scribbled: <i>“The key is always within the Word.”</i></p>

            <p>He typed the numbers into his computer, searching for patterns. Nothing obvious emerged. Then it clicked—these numbers might correspond to a **Bible verse**.</p>

            <h2>Scene 2: Seeking Advice</h2>
            <p>Lincoln hesitated but eventually emailed Dr. Prescott Chroix. Hours later, they sat across from each other in Chroix’s dimly lit office.</p>

            <p>Lincoln explained what he had found, sliding Holden’s notes across the desk.</p>

            <p>Chroix studied them, his fingers tapping rhythmically. “If Holden was encoding something within scripture, he wasn’t the first.”</p>

            <p>He leaned back and rattled off examples—Talmudic scholars, medieval monks, even World War II spies who hid messages in religious texts.</p>

            <p>Lincoln nodded but felt a growing unease—Chroix wasn’t just intrigued. He was <i>invested</i>.</p>

            <p>“So,” Lincoln asked, “what would you do next?”</p>

            <p>Chroix smirked. “You already know the answer, Lincoln.”</p>

            <h2>Scene 3: Decoding the Message</h2>
            <p>Back home, Lincoln cross-referenced the numbers with biblical texts. Each set pointed to a specific letter within a verse.</p>

            <p>The sequence: **4:7:5, 19:3:2, 12:9:4, 7:14:6**</p>

            <p>Using the **Book-Chapter-Verse-Letter** method, Lincoln extracted each letter, slowly assembling a phrase.</p>

                <li><b>LincolnWhitrush:</b> Found something strange in Holden's notes. A book-chapter-verse cipher. Anyone seen this before?</li>
                <li><b>EncryptedUser42:</b> Classic biblical coding. Seen it in old Masonic documents. What's the sequence?</li>
                <li><b>LincolnWhitrush:</b> 4:7:5, 19:3:2, 12:9:4, 7:14:6. Feels like a breadcrumb trail.</li>
                <li><b>Dr_PChroix:</b> Interesting. You’re following Holden’s work. I wouldn’t waste my time.</li>
                <li><b>LincolnWhitrush:</b> And why's that?</li>
                <li><b>Dr_PChroix:</b> Because some things were never meant to be found.</li>
