<h1>Chapter 5: The Map’s Secret</h1>

<h2>A Narrow Escape</h2>
<p>Lincoln barely had time to process the decoded message before Dorne’s smug expression darkened. The moment Lincoln scribbled down the translation, Dorne knew he was beaten.</p>

<p>“Give me the page,” Dorne said, stepping forward.</p>

<p>Lincoln tightened his grip on his notebook. “Not a chance.”</p>

<p>The monastery’s library was no place for a fight, but Lincoln had no doubt that Dorne wasn’t above making things physical. The man had resources, connections—Chroix’s influence backing him. But Lincoln had something else: a head start.</p>

<p>Without another word, he bolted.</p>

<p>The librarian, startled by the sudden movement, called out in protest, but Lincoln was already weaving through the stone corridors. Footsteps pounded behind him—Dorne was fast. Too fast.</p>

<p>Bursting through an arched doorway, Lincoln ducked into a side passage, pressing himself against the cold stone wall. Dorne’s steps thundered past. Lincoln exhaled, gripping his notebook. The map was hidden in plain sight. But where?</p>

<h2>Following the Clue</h2>
<p>Stepping cautiously into the monastery’s courtyard, Lincoln flipped back through his notes. The decoded message repeated in his mind:</p>

<blockquote><b>“The key to the map is hidden in plain sight.”</b></blockquote>

<p>His fingers traced the worn edges of the manuscript page he had taken. It wasn’t just an ancient text—it was a guide. The monks who had preserved it had left something behind. But what?</p>

<p>In the center of the courtyard stood a massive stone fountain. Its design was simple—too simple. But the base of the fountain bore intricate carvings, winding symbols that Lincoln hadn’t noticed before.</p>

<p>Then he saw it—a **worn engraving beneath the water’s edge**, only visible when the light struck it at a certain angle.</p>

<h3>The Hidden Message</h3>
<p>Lincoln pulled out his phone and took a photo of the inscription. It was obscured by **water stains and weathering**, but he knew this was **steganography**—a method of hiding messages in seemingly ordinary images.</p>

<p>Decrypt the hidden message in the image below:</p>

<!-- Placeholder for the steganographic image -->
<div id="puzzle-container">
    <img id="hidden-image" src="IMG_0830.png" alt="Image with hidden message">
    
    <p>Enter the decrypted message:</p>
    <input type="text" id="userInput" placeholder="Type your answer here">
    <button id="checkAnswer" onclick="validateAnswer()">Submit</button>
    
    <p id="message"></p>
    
    <!-- Hidden button to proceed to Chapter 6 -->
    <button id="nextChapter" onclick="goToNextChapter()">Continue to Chapter 6</button>
</div>

<script>
    document.getElementById("userInput").addEventListener("input", function() {
        document.getElementById("checkAnswer").style.display = this.value.trim() ? "block" : "none";
    });

    function validateAnswer() {
        const userAnswer = document.getElementById("userInput").value.trim().toLowerCase();
        const correctAnswer = "follow the fountain’s shadow at dawn"; // Expected plaintext message

        if (userAnswer === correctAnswer) {
            document.getElementById("message").textContent = "Correct! You have deciphered the hidden clue.";
            document.getElementById("message").style.color = "green";
            document.getElementById("nextChapter").style.display = "block";
        } else {
            document.getElementById("message").textContent = "Incorrect. Try again.";
            document.getElementById("message").style.color = "red";
        }
    }

    function goToNextChapter() {
        window.location.href = "chapter6.html"; 
    }
</script>
