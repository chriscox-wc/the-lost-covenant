    <h1>Chapter 6: The Encrypted Map</h1>

    <h2>The Hidden Photo</h2>
    <p>Lincoln’s heart raced as he scrutinized the decrypted message extracted from the steganographic image. The message was clear: <strong>“follow the fountain’s shadow at dawn.”</strong></p>
    <p>He glanced around the monastery’s courtyard, ensuring he wasn’t being watched. The ancient stone fountain stood at the center, its weathered carvings whispering secrets of bygone eras. The monks moved about their daily routines, oblivious to the clandestine discovery unfolding in their midst.</p>
    <p>Approaching the fountain, Lincoln noticed subtle differences between the physical structure and the archived photograph he had decrypted. The base of the fountain, adorned with intricate symbols, seemed to hold the key. Kneeling beside it, he traced his fingers over the carvings, feeling the cold stone under his touch.</p>

    <h2>The Mechanical Cipher Lock</h2>
    <p>As he examined the base, a concealed panel caught his eye. With a gentle push, it revealed a mechanical cipher lock—a relic from a time when secrets were guarded by ingenuity rather than technology.</p>
    <p>The lock comprised four rotating rings, each etched with a series of ancient symbols. To access the vault, Lincoln needed to align the rings correctly. The decrypted message had hinted at this mechanism, but the exact combination remained a mystery.</p>
    
    <h2>Unlock the Vault</h2>
    <p>The lock, old and intricate, challenged him with its rotating rings, each etched with mysterious symbols. He knew the answer was close, but what was the key?</p>
    
    <p>As Lincoln continued to study the area, he noticed a faded inscription on the stonework beneath the lock. Carefully wiping away centuries of grime, he revealed the words:</p>

    <blockquote><strong>"Beneath Lock, Seek Truth"</strong></blockquote>

    <p>The phrase seemed to be a clue, a riddle woven into the very fabric of the puzzle. Lincoln pondered the words. "Beneath Lock" could be a reference to the first letters of something important. Could the answer lie in the letters themselves?</p>

    <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Focus on the phrase “Beneath Lock, Seek Truth.” The first letters of each word hold the key to the puzzle: <strong>B, L, S, T</strong>.</p>

    <p>Each rotating ring of the lock is etched with symbols from the ancient Phoenician alphabet. To unlock the vault, Lincoln would need to align the symbols corresponding to the letters <strong>B, L, S, T</strong>. Use this clue to decipher the combination and open the vault.</p>

    <h2>Your Task: Decipher the Combination</h2>
    <p>The symbols on the rings correspond to letters in the ancient Phoenician alphabet. Align the correct sequence to unlock the vault.</p>
