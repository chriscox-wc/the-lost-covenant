        <h1>Chapter 7: The Order of the Veil</h2>

        <h2>The Descent</h3>
        <p>
            The heavy stone door groaned open, revealing a narrow staircase descending into darkness. Lincoln hesitated. 
            He glanced back at the monastery courtyard—still quiet, still undisturbed. The monks moved about their routines, 
            unaware of the secret that had been buried beneath their feet for centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a deep breath, he stepped forward. The air grew colder as he moved deeper underground. His phone’s flashlight 
            cut through the darkness, illuminating walls lined with ancient inscriptions. Some were in Latin, others in the 
            Phoenician script he had been decoding.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the bottom of the stairs, he reached a chamber—small, circular, and eerily silent. In the center stood a stone 
            pedestal, atop which rested a weathered leather-bound tome. The cover bore a symbol he recognized immediately: 
            the same emblem that had appeared in his research on medieval cryptography.
        </p>
        <p>
            As he reached for the book, a voice echoed from the shadows.
        </p>
        <p><strong>“You shouldn’t be here.”</strong></p>

        <p>
            Lincoln spun around. A hooded figure stepped forward, torchlight casting flickering shadows across the chamber walls. 
            Behind him, two more figures emerged, their faces obscured.
        </p>

        <h3>The Order Revealed</h3>
        <p>
            “The Order of the Veil has safeguarded these secrets for centuries,” the hooded figure continued, his voice calm but firm. 
            “What you seek is not meant for outsiders.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Lincoln’s mind raced. He had heard whispers of the Order before—an elusive group of scholars and protectors, sworn to keep 
            certain knowledge hidden from the world. But were they historians? Guardians? Or something else entirely?
        </p>
        <p>
            “Then why leave the clues?” Lincoln countered. “If this knowledge was meant to stay buried, why create a trail leading right to it?”
        </p>
        <p>
            The figure hesitated.
        </p>
        <p><strong>“Because some secrets must be earned. And some must be tested.”</strong></p>

        <p>
            From beneath his cloak, he produced a metal object—a cipher disk, identical to those used by Renaissance cryptographers. 
            He placed it on the pedestal beside the book.
        </p>
        <p><strong>“Prove you are worthy of the truth.”</strong></p>
