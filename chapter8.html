        <h1>Chapter 8: The Betrayal</h1>
        
        <section class="story">
            <p>The vault door groaned open, releasing a gust of stale, dust-laden air...</p>
            <p>Lincoln stepped inside, his heart pounding. His flashlight revealed rows of aged wooden shelves...</p>
            <p>At the far end of the chamber, resting on an ornate marble pedestal, lay the object he had risked everything to find.</p>
            <p><strong>The manuscript.</strong></p>
            <p>Bound in cracked leather and embossed with intricate gold filigree...</p>
            
            <p><strong>A Familiar Voice</strong></p>
            <p>A slow clap echoed through the chamber. “I have to say, I’m impressed, Lincoln.”</p>
            <p>The voice sent a jolt of cold through his veins. Dr. Prescott Chroix.</p>
            
            <p>From the shadows near the vault entrance, his former mentor stepped forward...</p>
            <p>“You never really trusted me, did you?” Lincoln asked.</p>
            <p>Chroix smirked. “On the contrary, I trusted you to be exactly who you are—relentless, brilliant… and far too naive.”</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Puzzle Within the Manuscript</strong></p>
            <p>Lincoln took a step back. “This isn’t just about the text, is it?”</p>
            <p>Chroix’s smirk widened. “Of course not. That manuscript holds more than just ancient writings—it contains a cryptographic fingerprint. The original checksum.”</p>
            
            <p>Lincoln’s phone buzzed again. A single message: <strong>“Trust no one.”</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>The Escape</strong></p>
            <p>Lincoln made his decision. He spun, shoving the manuscript into his backpack and bolting toward the shelves...</p>
            <p>Thinking fast, Lincoln yanked a towering shelf backward. It crashed to the ground...</p>
            <p>He had to get out. He had to decrypt the manuscript before Chroix did.</p>
