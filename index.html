        <h1>The Lost Covenant</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1: The Hidden Word</h2>

    <section class="story">
        <p>Lincoln Whitrush leans back in his chair, eyes flickering between multiple monitors. His job in the university’s digital restoration lab isn’t thrilling to most people, but to him, decrypting the past is just as exciting as cracking a modern security system.</p>
        <p>He’s part of a team working on an ambitious project: digitizing a private monastery’s collection of rare biblical texts.</p>
        <p>Most of the time, the process is straightforward—run scanned pages through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, verify accuracy, and flag any anomalies.</p>
        <p>Tonight, however, something is off.</p>

        <p>Lincoln notices a section in the Gospel of Matthew where the spacing between letters looks irregular—too inconsistent to be a simple printing quirk.</p>

        <p>“That’s weird,” he mutters, zooming in on the text.</p>

        <p>The university’s AI-assisted OCR flagged nothing unusual, but Lincoln knows machines miss things that human intuition can catch.</p>

        <h3>What is a Cipher?</h3>
        <p>Lincoln pulls out his notepad and starts jotting down the misaligned letters. He’s seen patterns like this before—in cryptography courses and historical cryptanalysis exercises.</p>
        <p>“Ciphers are one of the oldest tools of secrecy,” he thinks, recalling his professor’s words. “Before modern encryption, people relied on simple substitution systems to disguise messages from enemies.”</p>
        <p>He opens his terminal and runs the letters through a quick decryption script, trying a simple Caesar cipher.</p>

        <h3>History of the Caesar Cipher</h3>
        <p>The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption method named after Julius Caesar, who used it to send secure messages to his generals. It’s a substitution cipher, meaning each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet.</p>
        <p>Example: If you shift the alphabet by three places, ‘A’ becomes ‘D,’ ‘B’ becomes ‘E,’ and so on.</p>
        <p>The encryption is weak by modern standards but was effective in its time—only those who knew the shift number (the key) could decipher the message.</p>

        <p>Lincoln types in a simple script to decrypt the passage—but before he can confirm the translation, his screen flickers.</p>      
    </section>

    <section class="story">
        <p>Before he can react, a notification pops up on his screen:</p>

        <p><strong>“Unauthorized Access Attempt Detected”</strong></p>

        <p>Someone else has been searching these files. The exact same passage.</p>

        <p>Lincoln’s mind immediately shifts to cybersecurity protocol.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who else is accessing the file? Could this be a coincidence, or is someone actively monitoring his research?</li>
            <li>He checks the university’s access logs—an important tool in cybersecurity that tracks who enters sensitive files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>In modern cybersecurity, unauthorized access detection relies on intrusion detection systems (IDS), which flag suspicious activity in real time. These are essential for protecting sensitive information—whether it’s government data, financial records, or… ancient manuscripts?</h3>

        <p>But before he can investigate further, the connection suddenly drops.</p>

        <p>Someone doesn’t want him digging deeper.</p>

        <h3>What Next?</h3>
        <p>Lincoln reboots the system, but the encrypted files are now locked behind an access error.</p>

        <p>Someone—or something—just covered its tracks.</p>

        <p>And Lincoln isn’t sure if he just stumbled upon an ancient secret or stepped into something far bigger than he realizes.</p>
